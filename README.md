###About This Repository

[leetcode.py](./leetcode.py) is my first pass for leetcode, started from March, 2014. Didn't complete all of them and code weren't submitted to OJ.

[Leetcode](./Leetcode) is my second pass for leetcode, started from Jun, 2014. Each submission may contain several solutions to OJ, all passed.

[coding_index](./coding_index.md) is my summary, including some class notes from NC.

[zz_coding_index](./zz_coding_index.md) is the summary of leetcode questions by programming solutions, copied from Peking2.

[system_design](./system_design.md) is my summary to the system design questions.

[Whitebook](./WhiteBook) including some solutions from Career Cup 150 questions. Very basic.

[Concept Implement](./Concept_Implement) includes the python implementation of important CS concepts.

[Interviews](./Interviews) are real interview questions. Most of them are not in Leetcode.

[run.py](./run.py) is a script to test solutions when input is not very complicated. Just update the file name and function name in Solution and run the script.

[tool.py](./tool.py) has two functions:
* Combine all the solutions in [Leetcode](./Leetcode), output to [Solutions](./solutions.md)
* Generate the frequency map to [Frequency](./frequency.md)
